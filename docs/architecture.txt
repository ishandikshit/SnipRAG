SnipRAG Architecture Description

The architecture of SnipRAG consists of the following components:

1. PDF Processing Pipeline:
   - Input: PDF document
   - Text Extraction with coordinates
   - Page Image Rendering
   - Text Chunk Creation
   - Text Embedding Generation
   - Vector Index Storage

2. Search Pipeline:
   - Input: Natural language query
   - Query Embedding Generation
   - Semantic Search in Vector Index
   - Result Ranking
   - Coordinate Mapping
   - Image Snippet Extraction
   - Result Assembly

3. Key Components:
   - PDF Processor (PyMuPDF)
   - Text Embedder (Sentence-Transformers)
   - Vector Database (FAISS)
   - Coordinate Mapper
   - Image Snipper
   - Result Formatter

4. Data Flow:
   - PDF → Text Blocks with Coordinates → Text Chunks → Text Embeddings → Vector Index
   - Query → Query Embedding → Vector Search → Matching Text → Coordinate Lookup → Image Snippet Extraction → Final Results

The key innovation is the precise mapping between semantic text matches and their visual location in the document, allowing for targeted image snippet extraction.

Visual representation should show:
- The flow from PDF to text+coordinates to embeddings to search results
- The parallel storage of page images for later snippet extraction
- The connection between text matches and their corresponding image regions
- The final results showing both text and image snippets
